## Project Goal

Our project, WalkTime, will remedy long periods of inactivity by sending students actionable reminders to take a walk. We will use several data sources to build a personal model and contextual information. We would need to collect initial information from the user, such as hours in which a user would not be able to walk, as well as their school schedule to block off hours when they are busy. We would need to collect data regarding the user’s location and the weather at that current location via third-party libraries. We would also need to track the user’s step count with Google Fit.
